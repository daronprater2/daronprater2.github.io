These recommendations are based on assessment of neighborhood features, both current and projected, and customized by user preferences. User preferences are determined by a two step process: first, users answer a set of questions to estimate their weighting preferences; second, users can adjust the initial estimated weightings to more accurately reflect their requirements.  Time is added as a dimension to the decision-making process by projecting trends for important neighborhood attributes. Results of the recommendations are displayed in a user-interactive choropleth map of Chicago's zip codes with a color scheme corresponding to recommendation scores. Users can also view how Chicago neighborhoods differ at the individual factor level.
